<!-- 
->HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.
->It is a standard langauge for creating webpages
->Describes the structure of the website
->Consists of a series of elements
->HTML tells the browser what content is to be displayed and in what structure
->In short, it builds the skeleton of the website -->

<!-- HTMl elements are made with tags and attributes. Tags are created by using angular brackets <>. 
Some tags need a closing tag while others are self closing tags.
example: <h1>This is a Headding</h1> | <br> -> Self Closing Tag.
In this example: 
        -><h1> is the opening tag 
        ->"This is a heading" is the content
        -></h1> is a closing tag
        
Attributes:
        Attributes are simply the properties associated with the tags.
        Attributes are seperated using spaces
        <p color="red">Hello World</p>

<!-- 
The above given code is called as the boilerplate of HTML. 
The <!doctype html> is an HTML 5 tag which tells the browser that the file type is html.
Then we have the <html></html> tag, and everything else comes inside this.
After that we have the <head></head> tag. It consists of the title of the webpage and some metadata.  
Then we have the <body></body> tag, everything that you want to show on your webpage goes inside the body tag.
